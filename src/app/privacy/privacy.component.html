            <div class="part"><h2>Personal Data Explained</h2><p>Your personal data may only be processed by us with your given consent, when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, or when it is necessary for our compliance with a legal obligation. The processing of the personal data, the specific purposes for the processing, the legal basis for the processing, and for how long we store your personal data, is described below.</p>
                <p>We collect and process your name for the purpose of preventing fraud and money laundering, as well as making it possible for donors to know that any particular campaign is genuine. Your name is collected by us in order for us to perform on a contract to which you are a party, and because it is necessary for us to perform according to a legal obligation (anti-money laundering legislation).</p>
                <p>Your email address is collected and processed by us and shared with the individuals who own the fundraising campaigns to which you contribute. Your email address is collected by us in order for us to perform on a contract to which you are a party.</p>
                <p>Your address is collected by us only when tax relief (Gift Aid UK Only) is sought for a donation. The address is required for a campaign owner to submit to the UK government body Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs department (HMRC). Your address is in such case collected by us in order for us to perform on a contract to which you are a party.</p>
                <p>All of the above personal data is stored securely until you actively close your account. We send you reminders to close your account via email every twelve (12) months if you have become inactive.</p>
                <p>We use Mixpanel in order to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our service. This is done by tracking and analyzing the traffic and general behavior on our website.</p></div>

            <div class="part"><h2>How do charity partners use my data?</h2><p>We will share your personal data with those charities you donate to. When we pass your information to charities, they also become a controller with respect to such personal data. This means that they are responsible for their own compliance with data protection laws when they use your personal data, and all such use is subject to the charity’s own privacy notice. When charities receive your details, they are required to send you their privacy notice. GiveBrite is not responsible for charities’ use of your personal data or the charities’ compliance with applicable laws.</p>
                <p>When you donate to or create a fundraising page, GiveBrite will ask whether or not you consent to receiving email from the charity about the impact of your donation and other ways to support them including future events, campaigns and appeals. If you opt in to receiving such emails, we will pass your consent preference on to the charity, if it is subscribed to receive such reporting from us. Note that the charity will need to receive your personal data to send you emails you consent to receive.</p>
                <p>If you want to change your preferences for a charity to use your data (to contact you or otherwise), please contact the charity directly.</p>
